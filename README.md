# University FAQ Chatbot

# 📝 Overview

This project implements a rule-based University FAQ Chatbot using Python and the spaCy NLP library. It’s designed to answer frequently asked questions about university life 🎒—like admissions, courses, fees, and library services—by recognizing user intent and responding with helpful guidance 💬.



# ✨ Features

🧠 Natural Language Processing: Utilizes spaCy to tokenize, lemmatize, and clean up user input.

🎯 Intent Recognition: Matches queries to predefined intents (like "admission" or "fees") using keyword rules.

💻 Interactive Interface: Simple command-line experience for real-time chatting.

🛠️ Extensible FAQ System: Easily customizable intent-response structure for scaling across more topics.



# 💬 Interact with the Chatbot
Type a question like:

"What are the admission requirements?"

"Library timings?" …and get an immediate response!

Type 'exit' to end the session gracefully 👋


# 🧪 Example Interaction
University FAQ Chatbot

Type 'exit' to end the chat.

You: Hello  
Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you today?  
You: What are the fees?  
Chatbot: The fee structure varies by program. Check the 'Fees and Payments' page on our website.  
You: exit  
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day! 



# 🧩 Project Structure

How It Works

Preprocessing: preprocess_text uses spaCy to clean and prepare user input.

Intent Matching: match_intent_rule_based detects the closest intent from the input.

Response Generation: The chatbot picks a relevant answer from the faq_responses dictionary.

Chat Loop: The program keeps running until you type 'exit'.



# ⚠️ Limitations

Rule-based only: might not handle complex or vague questions.

Relies on fixed keywords, so phrasing matters!

No memory of past conversation or context awareness.



# 🚀 Future Improvements
Add machine learning for smarter intent classification.

Context tracking for multi-turn conversations.

Create a sleek web interface for broader accessibility.

Expand the FAQ scope to more departments and scenarios.
